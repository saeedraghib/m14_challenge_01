# *Neural Networking & Deep Learning - (m13_challenge_01):*<br><br>

## **Description:**<br>
You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

This project is designed to perform the following tasks:
<br>

Use algorithms of neural networking as well as deep learning to perform the following tasks:

### ***Task 1:***<br>
Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.
<br>
### ***Task 2:***<br>
Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.
<br>
### ***Task 3:***<br>
Optimize the neural network model.
<br>

## RESULTS<br>
There wasn't much of a change in accuracy when I increases the hidden layers or increased the epochs value.
<br>
The highest accuracy I could get is 73.01%

In addition to the original method, THREE alternative methods were used:<br>
Alternative Method 1: 2 hidden layers & 50 epochs<br>
Alternative Method 2: 2 hidden layers & 100 epochs<br>
Alternative Method 3: 3 hidden layers & 100 epochs<br>


## Technologies

The following packages and dependicies are needed for the proper functioning of the application:

### **pandas**:<br>
### **tensorflow**:<br>
### **Dense**:<br>
### **Sequential**:<br>
### **train_test_split**:<br>
### **StandardScaler**:<br>
### **OneHotEncoder**:<br>
<br>
