# *Algorithmic Trading - (m14_challenge_01):*<br><br>

## **Description:**<br>
In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Your firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, you’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

In a Jupyter notebook, you’ll do the following:
<br>

You’ll combine your new algorithmic trading skills with your existing skills in financial Python programming and machine learning to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets:

### ***Task 1:***<br>
Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.
<br>
### ***Task 2:***<br>
Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.
<br>
### ***Task 3:***<br>
Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.

## RESULTS<br>
<!---There wasn't much of a change in accuracy when I increases the hidden layers or increased the epochs value.-->
<br>
<!---The highest accuracy I could get is 73.01%
-->
<!--
In addition to the original method, THREE alternative methods were used:<br>-->

<!---
Alternative Method 1: 2 hidden layers & 50 epochs<br>
Alternative Method 2: 2 hidden layers & 100 epochs<br>
Alternative Method 3: 3 hidden layers & 100 epochs<br>
testing 123

## Technologies

The following packages and dependicies are needed for the proper functioning of the application:

### **pandas**:<br>
### **numpy**:<br>
### **pathlib**:<br>
### **hvplot**:<br>
### **matplotlib.pyplot**:<br>
### **sklearn**:<br>
<br>
